    <p style="margin:0"> <b>Measuring the Border Effect Among China's Provinces: A Structural Analysis </b> <br> with Yang Ye, Yameng Guo, and Haoyun Zhao</a> <br> 2024, R&R. <br><button class="accordion">
    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>This paper employs a structural model to estimate border effects among China’s provinces. The results indicate that, from 2002 to 2017, China experienced a rapid decline in objective trade costs—such as those related to distance and language differences—while institutional trade costs associated with provincial borders steadily increased. For example, in 2002, these institutional costs raised trade costs for inter-provincial goods by 38% compared to intra-provincial trade. Counterfactual analysis reveals that reducing institutional costs could significantly boost inter-regional trade flows and lower goods' price levels. On average, between 2002 and 2017, a 50% reduction in institutional costs would lead to a 51% increase in trade flows and a 5% decrease in price levels. Notably, the importance of mitigating institutional costs to promote inter-regional trade in China has grown over time. </p></div><br>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Technology-based startups are the main force in emerging industries and the source of disruptive technologies, but they face information barriers when acquiring knowledge, technology, and other resources necessary for innovation. As an important platform for connecting resources such as knowledge, technology, and capital, 'how' and 'through what channels' venture capital influences corporate technological innovation are still lacking reliable evidence and direct mechanisms in theory. Based on a matched database constructed from China's tax survey data, venture capital data, and granted invention patent data, this paper empirically tests the impact, mechanism, and source of venture capital on the technological innovation of technology-based startups, and verifies the role of venture capital in corporate innovation resource acquisition based on firm-pair level data. The study finds: (1) Venture capital enhances the quantity but not the quality of technological innovation in technology-based startups, and the results are more significant when venture capitalists with diversified information channels; (2) The embedding of technology-based startups in venture capital networks is beneficial for them to obtain innovation resources from formal channels such as technology transfer and R&D cooperation; (3) In the acquisition of innovation resources in technology-based startups, venture capital mainly plays the role of an “information broker” rather than a “reputation endorser”. The research in this paper will provide good theoretical insights and policy implications for accurately understanding the information barriers encountered in the innovation of technology-based startups, as well as for understanding the role and mechanism of venture capital in technological innovation. </p></div><br>

    
      
    <p style="margin:0"> <b>How City Size Affects Firm Survival? </b> <br> with Haoyun Zhao, Yang Ye, and Yameng Guo </a> <br> 2024, R&R. <br><button class="accordion">
    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Using data from the National Business Registrations and city-level statistics in China, this paper empirically investigates the relationship between city size and firm survival. The findings indicate that firms located in larger cities exhibit higher survival rates. However, the relationship between city size and firm survival is non-linear: while city size positively influences firm survival in smaller cities, this effect diminishes and becomes insignificant in larger cities. Mechanism analysis indicates that large cities generate positive externalities, including increased export activities, lower entry barriers, and enhanced innovation capacity, which offset the negative effects of high wages. Furthermore, we identify an inverted U-shaped relationship between city size and firm survival, with the optimal city population size estimated at 10.96 million. These results are robust across multiple specifications. </p></div><br>
