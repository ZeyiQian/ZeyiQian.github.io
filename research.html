This paper examines sectoral growth patterns across Chinese provinces during the country's economic takeoff in the early 2000s, following key policy reforms including trade liberalization, infrastructure expansion, business climate improvements, and relaxed rural-to-urban migration restrictions. We develop a spatial general equilibrium model based on the Melitz-Chaney framework to analyze how these factors interact and influence the geographic distribution of economic activity. Our model extends the heterogeneous firm approach to a multi-sector, multi-region setting, incorporating detailed sectoral and regional linkages. Using Chinese data, we calibrate the model and conduct counterfactual simulations to identify the key mechanisms driving regional development. Our results highlight manufacturing employment expansion as the primary driver of firm distribution and economic growth. While reductions in trade costs intensify competition and deter firm entry, improvements in the local business climate lower entry barriers and foster firm creation. Together, these factors shape China's overall economic growth and regional specialization. Finally, we quantify the contributions of manufacturing employment expansion, trade cost reductions, and business climate improvements to overall welfare gains. </p></div>

      <p style="margin:0"> <b>Scale Effects and Spatial Distribution of Firms: A Quantitative Analysis of Japanese Firms (Krugman) </b>  <br><button class="accordion">
      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This paper quantifies the role of firm-level scale economies in shaping the spatial distribution of firms and aggregate economic outcomes of Japan. We employ a spatial general equilibrium model based on the Krugman framework, calibrated to the Japanese economy in 2011. We simulate the model in levels and then introduce exogenous shocks to trade costs, technology, and firm entry to analyze their impact on firm distribution, aggregate GDP, and welfare. To isolate the contribution of scale economies, we compare these results with those obtained from a similar simulation using an Eaton-Kortum model, which, in its basic form, does not feature firm-level increasing returns to scale. Our findings reveal the extent to which the presence of scale economies in the Krugman model amplifies the effects of these shocks on Japan's aggregate economic performance compared to the EK model, thereby highlighting the significance of scale economies in the Japanese economic landscape. The analysis provides insights into the macroeconomic implications of agglomeration forces driven by scale economies in contrast to the mechanisms emphasized in trade models without such effects. </p></div><br> 

        
        
 <p style="margin:0"> <b>Trade Shock and Dynamic Labor Allocation (Eaton-Kortum)</b>  <br><button class="accordion">
      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> The early 21st century saw the U.S. economy undergoing a profound structural shift, driven by the "China shock" following China's accession to the WTO. This trade shock initially significantly affected U.S. manufacturing, causing widespread job losses and economic disruption. However, contrary to expectations, the shock also accelerated the growth of the service sector, which emerged as a primary driver of economic expansion. A key mechanism behind this transformation was reducing labor relocation costs, enabling workers—particularly those with lower education levels—to switch industries and maximize their life utility. This adjustment not only offset the negative effects of the trade shock but also contributed to a re-optimization of labor market allocation. To understand this counterintuitive outcome, we develop a dynamic spatial model grounded in the frameworks of CDP and ACM. Our model integrates declining labor relocation costs with heterogeneity in workers' education levels and labor mobility. Numerical exercises using a toy model show that reducing labor relocation costs allows more low-educated workers to transition into the service sector.  These findings highlight the critical role of declining labor relocation costs in mitigating trade shock impacts and achieving an optimal labor market allocation. </p></div><br> 

<p style="margin:0"> <b>Breaking Barriers: Regional Economic Integration and National Market Unification (Armington) </b> <br> with Haoyun Zhao</a><br><button class="accordion">
    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>This paper addresses the critical question of how regional economic integration affects national market unification in China. While regional integration initiatives have shown promise in reducing trade barriers within specific regions, their overall contribution to the broader national goal of market unification remains unclear. We use a model based on Anderson and Van Wincoop(2003) framework and conduct counterfactual analysis to evaluate the effects of regional integration initiatives, such as in the Yangtze River Delta and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, increases market connectivity, with welfare gains of 17.85% and 7.97%, respectively. However, we also identify a "club effect," where stronger domestic ties may increase trade costs with external regions. Ultimately, our results suggest that eliminating regional boundaries would reduce price index differences and promote greater national market integration, providing valuable insights for policymakers aiming to balance regional integration with national market unification. </p></div><br>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Using firm-level registration data and city-level statistics, this paper empirically investigates the relationship between city size and firm survival. The results reveal that firms in larger cities tend to have higher survival rates. Mechanism analysis suggests that larger cities create positive externalities—such as increased export opportunities, lower entry cutoff, and enhanced innovation capacity—that help mitigate the adverse effects of higher wages and costs. However, this positive relationship does not increase monotonically. We identify an inverted U-shaped relationship between Chinese city size and firm survival during 2001 to 2014, with an optimal city size of 5.59 million people, beyond which congestion costs begin to outweigh the agglomeration benefits. </p></div><br>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> When capital leaves a country and then flows back as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), we call it round-tripping FDI. It is widely suspected that China's official FDI statistics contain a substantial amount of round-tripping FDI. However, it is difficult to quantify the round-tripping FDI due to the lack of data. In this paper, we propose two methods to identify round-tripping FDI. The first one tracks capital flows at firm level. If a firm in China invests in a foreign firm and the foreign firm makes an investment back to China shortly after, then we consider this investment to China as round-tripping FDI. Our second measure of round-tripping FDI adds to the first measure by including investments in China made by Chinese investors/firms registered in tax havens. By this second method, round-tripping FDI accounts for as much as 65 percent of the total FDI China received from 1999 to 2015. Our firm-level analysis shows that industrial enterprises facing higher tax burdens are more likely to make round-tripping FDI. We also show that at the city level, adjusted FDI statistics by subtracting the estimated round-tripping FDI are better predictors of local imports and exports. Finally, we show that provinces receiving higher shares of round-tripping FDI are more likely to be punished for illegal financial activities. Taken together, these findings suggest that our measures of round-tripping FDI, although noisy, are indicative of real transactions. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> As an important supplement to formal agreements and institutional arrangements, the establishment of international twin cities has strengthened trust and in-depth communication between cities, becoming an important catalyst and booster for international economic cooperation. Based on the perspective of foreign trade high-quality development, this paper examines the impact of the“circle of friends” formed by international twin cities on the export trade between cities using the data of matching pairs between 287 Chinese cities and 136 countries or regions in 2002-2015.The results find that: (1)The agree ments ofinternational twin cities have significantly promoted the export volumeand export value of Chinese cities by 10.0%and 11.6% respectively.(2) The trade promotion effect of international twin cities is more derived from trade creation rather than trade transfer. (3）In addition to affecting exports by intensive margins, international twin cities have also promoted the expansion margins of exports in terms of the number of product types and the proportion of high-tech industries.(4)With SARS and the global financial crisis as incident impacts, the agreements of international twin cities has strengthened the ability of Chinese cities to resist risks in exports. (5)The results of heterogeneity analysis show that the agree ments of international twin cities have more obvious export promotion effect on non-Belt and Road countries and geographically adjacent countries in China. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> In the context of developing a high-level open economy, evaluating the impact and role of FDI from multiple perspectives is an important prerequisite for correctly drawing up the negative list of foreign investment access. From the perspective of enterprise survival and industrial security, this paper empirically tests the influence and mechanism of foreign capital on the host country. Specifically, on the basis of accurately measuring the survival rate of enterprises by using the micro big data of enterprise registration from SAIC (the State Administration of Industry and Commerce), we identify the economic effect of FDI on the host country from the perspective of enterprise survival, and examine the heterogeneity and mechanism of the Promotion Effect of FDI. At the same time, this paper also examines the impact of FDI on industrial security from the perspectives of technology availability, technology controllability and supply chain security. The results show that: (1) FDI significantly improves the survival rate of enterprises in host countries by encouraging new establishment of enterprises and reducing the death of existing enterprises. (2) Preference of foreign capital for local private enterprises in supply chain layout makes the survival promotion effect of private enterprises more obvious. (3) The entry of foreign capital promotes the survival of enterprises in host countries through efficiency and competition mechanism. (4) When the foreign investment market access policy intervention is less in the industry, FDI on the survival of the host country's enterprises to promote the effect is more obvious. (5) From the perspective of technology availability, technology controllability and supply chain security, FDI has improved the industrial security level of host country to a large extent. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> As the cornerstone of building a comprehensive transportation system and a modern economic system, CHSR（China High-speed Railway）has greatly changed the way of national production and life, affecting the efficiency of spatial allocation of resources and reshaping the economic geography. The rapid development of CHSR, on the one hand, leads to the spatial concentration of production factors and resources and the peripheral development of small and medium-sized cities; On the other hand, brings about the increasingly fierce competition among small and medium-sized cities for high-speed railway stations. Are small and medium-sized cities battle for high-speed rail stations to "compete for inferior"? In order to answer this "paradox", based on the night light data and density gradient index, this paper re-measures the spatial agglomeration degree with defining the capital city or the central city as the core. On this basis, a theoretical hypothesis of "man-bear race" between the central cities that open high-speed railway and the small and medium-sized cities that compete for high-speed railway is put forward, and the hypothesis is verified by data. The research findings of this paper are as follows.(1) The opening of high-speed railway leads to the agglomeration of economic activities to provincial capitals or central cities, while small and medium-sized cities are becoming the peripheries, that is, "people cannot run faster than bears"; (2) Compared with the small and medium-sized cities without high-speed rail, the small and medium-sized cities with high-speed rail can achieve relatively fast economic growth, that is, "running ahead of their competitors"; (3) The theoretical logic of "man-bear race" well explains the "paradox" that small and medium-sized cities compete for " inferior position" through high-speed railway stations, that is, "they can't run faster than bears, but they have to run faster than their partners". </p></div>
