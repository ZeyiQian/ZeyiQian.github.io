(3）In addition to affecting exports by intensive margins, international twin cities have also promoted the expansion margins of exports in terms of the number of product types and the proportion of high-tech industries.(4)With SARS and the global financial crisis as incident impacts, the agreements of international twin cities has strengthened the ability of Chinese cities to resist risks in exports. (5)The results of heterogeneity analysis show that the agree ments of international twin cities have more obvious export promotion effect on non-Belt and Road countries and geographically adjacent countries in China. </p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> In the context of developing a high-level open economy, evaluating the impact and role of FDI from multiple perspectives is an important prerequisite for correctly drawing up the negative list of foreign investment access. From the perspective of enterprise survival and industrial security, this paper empirically tests the influence and mechanism of foreign capital on the host country. Specifically, on the basis of accurately measuring the survival rate of enterprises by using the micro big data of enterprise registration from SAIC (the State Administration of Industry and Commerce), we identify the economic effect of FDI on the host country from the perspective of enterprise survival, and examine the heterogeneity and mechanism of the Promotion Effect of FDI. At the same time, this paper also examines the impact of FDI on industrial security from the perspectives of technology availability, technology controllability and supply chain security. The results show that: (1) FDI significantly improves the survival rate of enterprises in host countries by encouraging new establishment of enterprises and reducing the death of existing enterprises. (2) Preference of foreign capital for local private enterprises in supply chain layout makes the survival promotion effect of private enterprises more obvious. (3) The entry of foreign capital promotes the survival of enterprises in host countries through efficiency and competition mechanism. (4) When the foreign investment market access policy intervention is less in the industry, FDI on the survival of the host country's enterprises to promote the effect is more obvious. (5) From the perspective of technology availability, technology controllability and supply chain security, FDI has improved the industrial security level of host country to a large extent. </p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> As the cornerstone of building a comprehensive transportation system and a modern economic system, CHSR（China High-speed Railway）has greatly changed the way of national production and life, affecting the efficiency of spatial allocation of resources and reshaping the economic geography. The rapid development of CHSR, on the one hand, leads to the spatial concentration of production factors and resources and the peripheral development of small and medium-sized cities; On the other hand, brings about the increasingly fierce competition among small and medium-sized cities for high-speed railway stations. Are small and medium-sized cities battle for high-speed rail stations to "compete for inferior"? In order to answer this "paradox", based on the night light data and density gradient index, this paper re-measures the spatial agglomeration degree with defining the capital city or the central city as the core. On this basis, a theoretical hypothesis of "man-bear race" between the central cities that open high-speed railway and the small and medium-sized cities that compete for high-speed railway is put forward, and the hypothesis is verified by data. The research findings of this paper are as follows.(1) The opening of high-speed railway leads to the agglomeration of economic activities to provincial capitals or central cities, while small and medium-sized cities are becoming the peripheries, that is, "people cannot run faster than bears"; (2) Compared with the small and medium-sized cities without high-speed rail, the small and medium-sized cities with high-speed rail can achieve relatively fast economic growth, that is, "running ahead of their competitors"; (3) The theoretical logic of "man-bear race" well explains the "paradox" that small and medium-sized cities compete for " inferior position" through high-speed railway stations, that is, "they can't run faster than bears, but they have to run faster than their partners". </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> When capital leaves a country and then flows back as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), we call it round-tripping FDI. It is widely suspected that China's official FDI statistics contain a substantial amount of round-tripping FDI. However, it is difficult to quantify the round-tripping FDI due to the lack of data. In this paper, we propose two methods to identify round-tripping FDI. The first one tracks capital flows at firm level. If a firm in China invests in a foreign firm and the foreign firm makes an investment back to China shortly after, then we consider this investment to China as round-tripping FDI. Our second measure of round-tripping FDI adds to the first measure by including investments in China made by Chinese investors/firms registered in tax havens. By this second method, round-tripping FDI accounts for as much as 65 percent of the total FDI China received from 1999 to 2015. Our firm-level analysis shows that industrial enterprises facing higher tax burdens are more likely to make round-tripping FDI. We also show that at the city level, adjusted FDI statistics by subtracting the estimated round-tripping FDI are better predictors of local imports and exports. Finally, we show that provinces receiving higher shares of round-tripping FDI are more likely to be punished for illegal financial activities. Taken together, these findings suggest that our measures of round-tripping FDI, although noisy, are indicative of real transactions. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>During the period from 2000 to 2007, there was a significant shift in the spatial distribution of China's manufacturing sector. Labor-intensive enterprises established numerous factories in inland regions, while many import and export-oriented enterprises relocated to coastal areas. Within the framework of EK, we conducted counterfactual experiments to assess the welfare gains resulting from the redistribution of firm locations. Additionally, we utilized reduced form evidence to describe the pattern of firm location redistribution. </p></div><br>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> With the new global revolution of science and technology and industry transformation, new ventures with both advantages of scientific development and market prospects are the main force of Frontier Technology and Subversive Technology. At the same time, VC can mitigate resource constraints of these new ventures. However, there are goal differences and governance conflicts between venture capitalists and new ventures. The focus is on whether to choose the innovation-first strategy with high risk, long cycle and large investment or not. Is venture capital a blessing or a curse in the innovation activities of new ventures? This paper made an empirical test of this problem, basing on the survey database of key tax source enterprises, the venture capital database and the Chinese authorized invention patent database. The analysis shows that VC puts more emphasis on R&D inputs of new enterprises than on short-term returns. That means VC chooses the innovation-first strategy rather than the market-first strategy. This conclusion still shows that the effect of blessing of venture capital is reflected in the joint improvement of both the quantity and quality of technological innovation of new enterprises. We also find that VC can possibly increase the market value of new ventures and improve them to become "unicorns". Finally, we find that the effect of blessing of venture capital on technological innovation of new ventures is characterized by the heterogeneity of venture capital nature, industry risk and market structure. Our findings have important enlightenment on understanding how VC affects the innovation activities of the new enterprises under the resource constraint. </p></div><br>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Big cities exhibit both positive and negative externalities. Does a larger urban scale result in better survival for enterprises? Utilizing the Schumpeter multi-sector model, this article analyzes data from 291 Chinese prefecture-level cities to examine the impact of city size and population growth rate on enterprise survival. Results indicate that: (1) Enterprise survival rates increase with larger city size, but faster population growth rates place additional pressure on enterprise survival, particularly in peripheral cities. (2) Using interactive item verification methods, we find that big cities possess positive externalities that lower the threshold for enterprise production, improve levels of enterprise innovation, and reduce enterprise costs. However, high foreign trade dependence in big cities does not significantly impact enterprise survival rates. (3) An inverted U-shaped relationship between city size and enterprise survival rates is further clarified. </p></div><br>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Solving the problem of poverty among the population is not only the responsibility of government officials but also a strategic orientation of the country. Many policies and official performance goals are geared towards alleviating poverty in underdeveloped regions. However, labeling a region as "impoverished" may attract more resources, which conflicts with the criterion of "removing the hat", an important evaluation parameter. This paper uses data from turnover of local officials at the county level and the CES model to analyze and test which development modes local officials focus on after taking office. The research finds that: (1) the replacement of local officials does not contribute significantly to short-term economic growth in the region and does not significantly improve individual poverty; (2) especially after setting the poverty standard, the replacement of local officials makes the region more likely to fall into the poverty list, leading to competition for the "poverty" label; (3) poor areas are more affected by the replacement of officials than non-poor areas, which ultimately reflects in the results of lifting them out of poverty. This leads to the development pattern of "wanting to remove the hat after wearing it, but wanting to wear the hat without removing it". </p></div><br>

    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> With China's further opening up to the world, Japan's direct investment in China has become an important part of China's external economic development. However, due to historical issues, various disputes and conflicts often accompany the process of establishing a friendly cooperative partnership between the two countries, resulting in many risks in their economic and trade relations and investments. From this perspective, this article studies the long-term effects of the harm caused by war on Japan's direct investment and trade in China. Using matched databases constructed from various sources, such as China's industrial enterprise database, China's city statistical yearbook, China's customs database, Tsinghua University's database on great power relations, data on foreign direct investment, and a series of research books on China's population casualties and property losses during the War of Resistance against Japan, the article uses an adjusted FCVL model to verify whether the harm caused by war is China's scars or Japan's redemption. The study found that: (1) The harm caused by the war in China is negatively correlated with Japan's direct investment at the regional level, especially when significant events worsen Sino-Japanese relations, the negative impact of the harm caused by war on Japan's direct investment becomes even more severe. (2) With changes in Sino-Japanese relations, to avoid unpredictable risks, regions that suffer more from war damage receive less investment from Japan, but there is an increase in imports and exports, which shows a more conservative way of "reducing risks and seeking redemption" by replacing investment with imports and exports. (3) From the perspective of enterprise survival, even if there are international risks, Japanese-funded enterprises and enterprises engaged in import and export trade with Japan are less risky, and Japanese-funded enterprises in cities with severe harm caused by war face lower survival pressures, indicating the possibility of "reserving redemption". The results remain robust after placebo tests and exclusion of other effects. </p></div><br>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> As an important product of China's path to becoming a technological power, new energy vehicles are a key target for government encouragement in cutting-edge technology research and green high-quality development. However, there is still much controversy over how government subsidies can effectively promote technological progress in new energy vehicle companies. Based on this issue, this paper focuses on the new energy vehicle industry, measures the promotion effect of government subsidies on the innovation level of Chinese new energy vehicle companies, and assesses the bias towards technological progress. The study finds that: (1) From the perspective of the total patent applications and green patent applications of companies, government subsidies have a bias towards the technological progress of new energy vehicle companies, that is, subsidies stimulate the quantity of innovation, but the promotion of the quality of innovation still needs to be strengthened. At the same time, market competition can deepen the positive impact of government subsidies on the quantity of innovation. (2) Based on the analysis of the differences among heterogeneous new energy vehicle companies, the innovation level of non-state-owned and high-tech companies is more influenced by the incentive effect of government subsidies. (3) From the perspective of the industrial chain, government subsidies make companies tend to innovate in basic resources, core components, downstream vehicles, and backend applications. </p></div><br>
