    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> As an important supplement to formal agreements and institutional arrangements, the establishment of international twin cities has strengthened trust and in-depth communication between cities, becoming an important catalyst and booster for international economic cooperation. Based on the perspective of foreign trade high-quality development, this paper examines the impact of the“circle of friends” formed by international twin cities on the export trade between cities using the data of matching pairs between 287 Chinese cities and 136 countries or regions in 2002-2015.The results find that: (1)The agree ments ofinternational twin cities have significantly promoted the export volumeand export value of Chinese cities by 10.0%and 11.6% respectively.(2) The trade promotion effect of international twin cities is more derived from trade creation rather than trade transfer. (3）In addition to affecting exports by intensive margins, international twin cities have also promoted the expansion margins of exports in terms of the number of product types and the proportion of high-tech industries.(4)With SARS and the global financial crisis as incident impacts, the agreements of international twin cities has strengthened the ability of Chinese cities to resist risks in exports. (5)The results of heterogeneity analysis show that the agree ments of international twin cities have more obvious export promotion effect on non-Belt and Road countries and geographically adjacent countries in China. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> In the context of developing a high-level open economy, evaluating the impact and role of FDI from multiple perspectives is an important prerequisite for correctly drawing up the negative list of foreign investment access. From the perspective of enterprise survival and industrial security, this paper empirically tests the influence and mechanism of foreign capital on the host country. Specifically, on the basis of accurately measuring the survival rate of enterprises by using the micro big data of enterprise registration from SAIC (the State Administration of Industry and Commerce), we identify the economic effect of FDI on the host country from the perspective of enterprise survival, and examine the heterogeneity and mechanism of the Promotion Effect of FDI. At the same time, this paper also examines the impact of FDI on industrial security from the perspectives of technology availability, technology controllability and supply chain security. The results show that: (1) FDI significantly improves the survival rate of enterprises in host countries by encouraging new establishment of enterprises and reducing the death of existing enterprises. (2) Preference of foreign capital for local private enterprises in supply chain layout makes the survival promotion effect of private enterprises more obvious. (3) The entry of foreign capital promotes the survival of enterprises in host countries through efficiency and competition mechanism. (4) When the foreign investment market access policy intervention is less in the industry, FDI on the survival of the host country's enterprises to promote the effect is more obvious. (5) From the perspective of technology availability, technology controllability and supply chain security, FDI has improved the industrial security level of host country to a large extent. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> As the cornerstone of building a comprehensive transportation system and a modern economic system, CHSR（China High-speed Railway）has greatly changed the way of national production and life, affecting the efficiency of spatial allocation of resources and reshaping the economic geography. The rapid development of CHSR, on the one hand, leads to the spatial concentration of production factors and resources and the peripheral development of small and medium-sized cities; On the other hand, brings about the increasingly fierce competition among small and medium-sized cities for high-speed railway stations. Are small and medium-sized cities battle for high-speed rail stations to "compete for inferior"? In order to answer this "paradox", based on the night light data and density gradient index, this paper re-measures the spatial agglomeration degree with defining the capital city or the central city as the core. On this basis, a theoretical hypothesis of "man-bear race" between the central cities that open high-speed railway and the small and medium-sized cities that compete for high-speed railway is put forward, and the hypothesis is verified by data. The research findings of this paper are as follows.(1) The opening of high-speed railway leads to the agglomeration of economic activities to provincial capitals or central cities, while small and medium-sized cities are becoming the peripheries, that is, "people cannot run faster than bears"; (2) Compared with the small and medium-sized cities without high-speed rail, the small and medium-sized cities with high-speed rail can achieve relatively fast economic growth, that is, "running ahead of their competitors"; (3) The theoretical logic of "man-bear race" well explains the "paradox" that small and medium-sized cities compete for " inferior position" through high-speed railway stations, that is, "they can't run faster than bears, but they have to run faster than their partners". </p></div>
